They say old man Miller disappeared one Halloween night fifty years ago, and his spirit still haunts the property. Tonight, on a dare, you've decided to explore the abandoned house. The moon is full, the wind howls through the trees, and the old house stands dark and foreboding before you.</p>
            <p class="story-text">Your friends are waiting in the car, too scared to join you. They promised to wait exactly one hour before calling for help if you don't return.</p>

            <p class="story-text">The front door groans loudly as you push it open. A cloud of dust billows out, making you cough. Inside, the air is thick and stale. Moonlight filters through a broken window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. To your left, a staircase leads upward into darkness. Straight ahead, a hallway extends deeper into the house. From somewhere above, you hear a faint scratching sound.</p>

            <p class="story-text">You circle around to the back of the house, pushing through overgrown bushes. You find a window with a broken pane. After carefully clearing the glass shards, you climb through into what appears to be a kitchen. The room is filled with decaying cabinets and a large, old-fashioned stove. On the counter, something glints in the moonlight - an old, tarnished silver locket.</p>

            <p class="story-text">You carefully ascend the creaking stairs. At the top, you find a hallway with several doors. The scratching sound seems to be coming from behind the door at the end of the hall. You enter what appears to be the master bedroom. The room is surprisingly intact, with a large canopy bed and a vanity table. On the vanity, you find a journal open to a specific page.</p>

            <p class="story-text">You move down the hallway and enter a large living room. Furniture is covered in white sheets, giving the room a ghostly appearance. On the mantelpiece, you notice several framed photographs. As you look closer, you realize the people in the photos all have their eyes scratched out.
